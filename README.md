This is a project to implement the stock ticker application

It has been coded in IntelliJ, with Kotlin and Springboot.

The 3 endpoints are found:

http://localhost:8080/popular-stocks
http://localhost:8080/sum-stocks
http://localhost:8080/stocks/stock-#

Where # is a number between 1 and 10.

Further improvements would be to provide a pretty interface to show further details about the result, such as timestamps
